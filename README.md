## About
I've named this project as Shenlong as he is the final most boss of the popular fighting game "Bloody Roar 2"(Also provided in this repositoryby the name Bloody Roar 2 game.exe).<br><br>
Coming to the main point ,Shenlong(This project) is a python program/bot which leverages the Computer-Vision and Deep Learning technique to play the mentioned game autonomously.It can perfectly 
immitate the gameplay at a level similar to a 12 yr old kid who knows only 2 buttons
of the keyboard and knows only 3 character moves.
<br><br>
Things Shenlong cannot do - <br>
1)Play better than a 12yr old knowing 3 keyboard buttons <br>
2)Play better than a 12 yr old knowing 4 character moves.<br>
3)Play better than a 13yr old (Doesn't matter how many buttons or moves he/she knows).

## Getting Started
Before getting started make sure u have python installed on you device<br>
1. **Clone this repository / Download the ZIP File**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/prathamk1483/ShenLong.git
    ```
2. **Open "Bloody Roar 2 game.exe" already present in the repo**
3. **Make sure that this game is running in the top-left corner of the screen exactly as shown**

This is because I've hardcoded the programe to capture screen 600x480 (width x height) from the top left corner with co-ordinates(0,0).<br>
5. **Run main.py**

   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   It will take some time to import all the required libraries and packages and will start <br>
   Till then make sure the game window is visible to you, if not - bring the game window to the front (the program can run in the background as well)<br><br><br>

   <br>
   <br>
   <br>
   Once the progam is finished importing files and libraries , a new window with title **BONES** will pop-up, make sure to move it aside if it pop above the game window.
